# AI-based Drop-out Prediction and Counseling System (Prototype)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a prototype for an **AI-based drop-out prediction and counseling system**.  
It integrates multiple datasets (`students`, `attendance`, `marks`, `fees`), flags **at-risk students** using both **rule-based thresholds** and **machine learning models**, and produces a consolidated output.

The goal is to help **mentors and institutions** identify struggling students early and notify parents/guardians for timely intervention.
